    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\"—which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods).\n",

    "OOP helps us design code that is modular, reusable, and easier to understand, especially for large projects."

    "### **Hard to Understand? Let’s Use a Real-World Example!**\n",
    "Let’s say you are building a neighborhood full of houses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every house follows a blueprint—the design plan. This is your class.\n",
    "2. When a house is built using that blueprint, it becomes an actual house—this is your object.\n",
    "3. Each house can have different colors and number of rooms, but all follow the same structure.\n",
    "4. Similarly in OOP, a class defines what kind of data and behaviors the objects will have.\n",
    "5. When you create an object, you're building a specific house from the blueprint.\n",
